## Prepare phrase:
### Dataset information
* [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) - Data source
* This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 - 05.12.2016. 30 eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

### Dataset structure
The data for approximately 30 people is in **long format**, covering the period from March 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016. However, not every day or every person is recorded.

Initially, the dataset was split into two folders for two months, each containing a different number of .csv files. The organization was complex, so I **created a table to compare and categorize the files** in each folder. After getting an overview, I examined each file closely. Here is a summary of the dataset structure:

**Main elements:**
- "Steps" (number of steps taken), 
- "Calories" (number of calories burned)
- "Intensities" (distance and time for each activity type).
    - These factors were recorded in minutes, hours, and days. 
    - The data is quite consistent; the sum of minute-level data matches the hourly sheets, and the sum of hourly data matches the daily sheets.
- Additionally, "Heart rate" was recorded in seconds.

⇒ I also discovered that some files contain millions of rows, making processing them in Google Sheets time-consuming. Therefore, I **used BigQuery for this project**. To simplify the data analysis process, I **aggregated the data into daily summaries, creating two tables for daily activity data and sleep data**.

---
## Process phrase:

### 1. Create daily activity table 
In order to have large time scale, after upload the dataset on BigQuery, I **merged two dailyActivity_merged from two folders** (”Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16” and “Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16”). Then, I save the result as new table for later data manipulation
- **Problem:** After merged the two tables, I checked for duplicates in the primary key (the combination of `Id` and `ActivityDate`) and discovered **24 duplicates**. The issue was traced back to the table in the "Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16" folder, which contained 24 records from April 12, 2016, despite the data being intended for the period between March 12, 2016, and April 11, 2016.
``` sql
-- Create merged table for daily activity
CREATE TABLE `capstoneproject-429913.fitabase.DailyActivity` AS
	-- 'dailyActivity_merged.csv' table from ”Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16” folder
	SELECT * FROM `capstoneproject-429913.fitbit_data.dailyActivity_1203-1104`
UNION ALL 
	-- 'dailyActivity_merged.csv' table from “Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16” folder
	SELECT * FROM `capstoneproject-429913.fitbit_data.dailyActivity_1204-1205`
ORDER BY Id, ActivityDate;

-- Checking for duplicate primary key
SELECT
    Id,
    ActivityDate,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM `capstoneproject-429913.fitabase.DailyActivity`
GROUP BY
    Id,
    ActivityDate
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1
```
-  **Solution:** Because duplicate rows have the same primary key and different value in others fields, so we cannot use SELECT DISTINCE to remove duplicates. I solved this problem by assigning a row number to each row in each primary key group. If the one primary key have more than one row, the first row in will receive number 1, the next row will receive number 2, and so on. Then I order them so that the row we want will receive number 1 and we set the condition for the query to only select rows with number 1.
```sql
-- Create the table `daily_activity` without the error records
CREATE TABLE `capstoneproject-429913.fitabase.daily_activity` AS
-- Select needed columns (except rn column) where rn = 1
SELECT
    Id,
    ActivityDate,
    TotalSteps,
    TotalDistance,
    TrackerDistance,
    LoggedActivitiesDistance,
    VeryActiveDistance,
    ModeratelyActiveDistance,
    LightActiveDistance,
    SedentaryActiveDistance,
    VeryActiveMinutes,
    FairlyActiveMinutes,
    LightlyActiveMinutes,
    SedentaryMinutes,
    Calories,
FROM
	-- Subquery to handle duplicates
	(
		SELECT
			*,
			-- Assign a unique number to each row in each primary key group 
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Id, ActivityDate ORDER BY ActivityDate DESC) AS rn
		-- Merged table which contain duplicates
        FROM `capstoneproject-429913.fitabase.DailyActivity`
	) AS duplicates
-- Filter to keep only rows with number 1
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY Id, ActivityDate
```

### 2. Create Daily sleep table 
**Problem**: To have sleep data by day for the period March 12, 2016 - May 12, 2016, I need to combine table from two folders ("Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16" and "Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16") and I encountered several issues:
- **Inconsistent date formats** ("m/dd/yyyy 12:00:00 AM"), which BigQuery couldn't automatically parse.
        **⇒ Solution:** Manually defined the `SleepDay` column as STRING to upload the table on BigQuery. After uploaded, converted the relevant date data to DATE format.

- **Aggregate sleep data by day** from the “minuteSleep_merged” table (only had a "value" column with three possible values [1, 2, 3])
**⇒ Solution:** Column `TotalMinutesAsleep` is aggregated by counting values [1] in the `value` column. Column `TotalTimeInBed`is aggregated by counting all values in the `value` column. I figured out those recipes by by researched the relationship between the two tables “minuteSleep_merged” and  “sleepDate_merged” in the folder “Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16”, which already have been compiled but I don't use it because after aggregate a sleep data by day table myself, I noticed that the existing table is missing some records.
- **Duplicates problems**
    - **Duplicate rows (same in all fields)** 
    **⇒ Solution:** using `SELECT DISTINCT` when query. Have to handle before aggregate sleep data by day otherwise it can affect the result.
    - **Duplicate primary key** (only the `Id` and `SleepDate` columns are the same): this happens when I merge aggregated data into "daily_sleep" table. The reason is because the table from March 12, 2016 - April 11, 2016 has an additional record of April 12, 2016, while the table from April 12, 2016 - May 12, 2016 has an additional record of April 11, 2016.
    **⇒ Solution:** Remove records that do not match the time period in the table

```sql
-- Create a new table called `daily_sleep` in the main dataset 
CREATE TABLE `capstoneproject-429913.fitabase.daily_sleep` AS
    -- Aggregate sleep data by day from March 12, 2016 - April 11, 2016
    SELECT
        Id,
        -- Extract the date from a datetime
        EXTRACT(DATE FROM date_time) AS SleepDate,
        -- Count the number of value [1] to create TotalMinutesAsleep column
        COUNT(CASE WHEN value = 1 THEN 1 END) AS TotalMinutesAsleep,
        -- Count the total number of values to create TotalTimeInBed column
        COUNT(value) AS TotalTimeInBed
    FROM 
        -- Subquery to select and parse date values
        (
	        SELECT DISTINCT
		        Id,
                PARSE_DATETIME('%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', date) AS date_time,
                value
	            -- "minuteSleep_merged" table from "Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16" folder
	        FROM `capstoneproject-429913.fitbit_data.minuteSleep_1203-1204`
	        -- Exclude rows where the parsed date is '2016-04-12'
	        WHERE EXTRACT(DATE FROM PARSE_DATETIME('%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', date)) != '2016-4-12'
	  )
	-- Group the count function by Id and SleepDate
	GROUP BY Id, SleepDate
UNION ALL
	-- Aggregate sleep data by day from April 12, 2016 - May 12, 2016
	SELECT
        Id,
        -- Extract the date from a datetime
        EXTRACT(DATE FROM DateTime) AS SleepDate,
        -- Count the number of value [1] to create TotalMinutesAsleep column
        COUNT(CASE WHEN value = 1 THEN 1 END) AS TotalMinutesAsleep,
        -- Count the total number of values to create TotalTimeInBed column
        COUNT(value) AS TotalTimeInBed
	FROM
        -- Subquery to select and parse date values
        (
            -- SELECT DISTINCT to avoid duplicates
            SELECT DISTINCT
                Id,
                -- Converts 'date' column from STRING to a DATETIME format
                PARSE_DATETIME('%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', date) AS DateTime,
                value
		  -- "minuteSleep_merged" table from "Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16" folder
		  FROM `capstoneproject-429913.fitbit_data.minuteSleep_1204-1205`
		  -- Exclude rows where the parsed date is '2016-04-11'
		  WHERE EXTRACT(DATE FROM PARSE_DATETIME('%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', date)) != '2016-4-11'
	  )
	-- Group the count function by Id and SleepDate
	GROUP BY Id, SleepDate
ORDER BY Id, SleepDate
```

### 3. Inspect the data in the tables used for analysis
**Daily Activity table**
- Check for duplicates again: **No duplicates**
- Check for null values: **No null values**
- Check total active minutes in one day (Very ActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes + LightlyActiveMinutes + SedentaryMinutes, if the total is greater than 24 hours, the data is wrong): **No error data**
- **Min/Max/Average `Calories` burned**
- **Min/Max/Average `TotalSteps`**
- **Min/Max/Average `TotalDistance`**
- Check for abnormalities between `TotalDistance` and `TrackerDistance`
    - TotalDistance !=  TrackerDistance: 30 records
    - TotalDistance <  TrackerDistance: 1 record
    
**Daily Sleep Table**
- Check for duplicates again: **No duplicates**
- Check for null values: **No null values**
- Check `TotalMinutesAsleep` and `TotalTimeInBed` in one day (If the total is greater than 24 hours, the data is wrong): **No error data**
- **Min/Max/Average `TotalMinutesAsleep`**
- **Min/Max/Average `TotalTimeInBed`**
- Check if `TotalMinutesAsleep` > `TotalTimeInBed`: **No error data**

## Analyze phrase:
I will use Tableau to visualize my data. Before that, I summarize the daily data into key metrics to simplify and improve the accuracy of the charting process:
- **Daily activity data**
    - **TotalUsedDays:** Number of days the device was used. Each person has different recorded days and times, likely because data is only recorded when the device is worn. This metric indicates users' device usage habits.
    - **AvgMinsUsed:** Average minutes using the device per day.
    - **AvgSteps:** Average steps per day.
    - **AvgCalories:** Average calories burned per day.
    - **AvgVeryActive:** Average minutes of very active activity per day.
    - **AvgFairlyActive:** Average minutes of fairly active activity per day.
    - **AvgLightlyActive:** Average minutes of lightly active activity per day.
    - **AvgSedentary:** Average minutes of sedentary activity per day.
    - **ActivityType:** Classifies users based on activity intensity:
        - Calculate each person's average time spent on each activity type (Very Active, Fairly Active, Lightly Active, Sedentary).
        - Instead of using the overall average of all records, calculate the overall average based on each person's average active time.
        - Determine each person's predominant activity type by calculating the relative difference between their average active time and the overall average for each activity type. The activity type with the greatest relative difference is their predominant type.
        ⇒ Using relative differences is more accurate than absolute differences because activity types vary in scale. Relative differences, often expressed in percentages, make it easier to compare differences between groups.

- **Daily Sleep Data**: I classify users' sleep type based on their sleep duration.
    - I assess each day's sleep using three criteria: Sleepless (less than 6 hours), Normal Sleep (6 to 8 hours), and Oversleep (more than 8 hours).
    - From this classification, I calculate the proportion of each sleep type over the total days. This metric helps reduce discrepancies as each user has a different number of recorded days and I  also exclude users with fewer than 10 recorded days.
    - Finally, I classify each user's sleep type based on the most frequent sleep type.

```sql
-- Create a summarize table 'users_summarize'
CREATE TABLE `capstoneproject-429913.fitabase.users_summarize` AS
    SELECT
        -- Select all columns from the Activity subquery

⇒ After compiling all the data tables I needed, I uploaded them to Tableau, including:
- **"user_summary" table**: contains metrics such as average parameters, number of days of use, ...
- **"daily_activity" table**: Contains data for each user on multiple days about key indicators such as calories, steps, activity intensity
- **"daily_sleep" table**: contains data about user's sleep by day

### Data exploration
- **Steps vs. Calories by Activity Type:** There is a correlation between the number of steps taken and the number of calories burned. The trend line shows that more steps result in more calories burned. This is not just an obvious thing because these are calories burned during a day with many different activities (not just walking). To clarify, add Activity Type to the chart:
    - Fairly Active and Very Active groups tend to take more steps and burn more calories. All “Very Active” individuals have higher steps than average, while all “Sedentary” individuals have fewer steps than average.
- **Average Calories and Average Steps by Activity Type** chart takes a closer look into the relationship between each Activity Type and Calories burned or Steps taken. It shows a clear correlation between Activity Type and Average Steps, where higher intensity activities result in more steps. Walking or running appears to be a key factor in determining user activity intensity.
    - Although there is no clear correlation between Average Calories and Activity Type, but “Very Active” individuals still burn the most calories. This insight can help tailor nutritional and exercise recommendations based on individual calorie-burning capabilities.
- **Average Daily Device Usage Time by Sleep Type and User ID** chart shows that “Unclassified” users by sleep type generally have the highest daily device usage time. The paradox is that their sleep data isn't recorded despite high device usage (1302 - 1432 mins/day). Possible reasons include:
    - Users may not know how to enable or have technical issues with sleep data recording.
    - Sleep tracking features might not be commonly used.
    - Lack of motivation to track sleep.
- **Compare Time Asleep and Time in Bed by Sleep Type** chart reveals the relationship between sleep duration and time in bed by Sleep type. Notably, the Sleepless group (average 4 hours per day) and has the largest difference between sleep time and time in bed. Possible explanations:
    - They might be doing other activities in bed instead of sleeping.
    - They may have difficulty falling asleep, requiring more time in bed before actually sleeping.
- Additionally, I hoped to find some insights from relationship between the total number of device usage days and sleep quality, activity type, or other metrics. However, after exploring these relationships through various charts, no clear correlations emerged.

## Share phrase:
### 1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
**Insight:**
- **Compare Time Asleep and Time in Bed by Sleep Type:**
    - The **Sleepless group** (average 4 hours per day) has the largest difference between sleep time and time in bed.
    => Possible reasons: they might be doing other activities in bed instead of sleeping, or they may have difficulty falling asleep, requiring more time in bed before actually sleeping.
- **Average Daily Device Usage Time by Sleep Type and User ID:**
    - “Unclassified” users by sleep type generally have the highest daily device usage time, yet their sleep data isn't recorded (1302 - 1432 mins/day).
    => Possible reasons: users may not know how to enable or have technical issues with sleep data recording, sleep tracking features might not be commonly used, or lack of motivation to track sleep.
